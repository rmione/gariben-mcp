Hadn't experimented with model context protocols before so I thought a basic project would be fun. 

## Basic Idea
Desired outcomes and things I want to try
- leverage the power of LLMs and attempt to experiment with summarizing information from immersion, and using it to create mmnemonics. I don't think this would be more effective than creating them by yourself, but could be helpful. 
- try using MCP to access DB (out of morbid curiousity) and create Anki cards or at least AnkiConnect compatibile JSON.
- I want to experiment with giving an LLM like info about your language learning level and see how relevant its advice was
